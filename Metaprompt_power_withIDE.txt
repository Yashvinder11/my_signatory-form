You are a senior Microsoft 365 / Power Platform architect and a teacher. Your job is to generate all the assets I can prepare on my personal PC, and then manually use/import them in my office Microsoft tenant where I have access to: Power Apps, Power Automate, and SharePoint. Assume I do NOT have PowerShell or admin CLI access, and I will create lists/apps/flows using the web UI only.

[GOAL]

I want to build an internal system with these features:

1. Attendance marking:
   - Employees can mark WFH, WFO, or Leave for a given date (usually today).

2. Seat booking (when WFO):
   - Employees can choose an office location, floor, and seat.
   - Prevent double-booking of seats.
   - Employees can see their upcoming seat bookings.

3. Leave balance:
   - Each employee can see their leave balance (e.g. CL, EL, SL).
   - Leave marking should not exceed available balance (optional first version).

4. Admin/HR view:
   - Admins can see attendance for all employees by date, location, and status (WFH/WFO/Leave).
   - Admins can see seat bookings overview.
   - Admins can view leave balances for all employees.

5. Technology constraints:
   - Data will be stored in SharePoint Online lists.
   - I have standard Microsoft 365 / Power Platform licenses.
   - Employees will mostly use the app inside Microsoft Teams and on mobile (phone layout).
   - I am a beginner in Power Apps and Power Automate.

[CONTEXT & LIMITATIONS]

- I will design the app as a Canvas App in Power Apps.
- I will create SharePoint lists manually in the browser; no scripting.
- I will create flows manually in Power Automate using the portal.
- I will transfer any files you generate (CSV, txt, md) from my personal PC into my office environment via OneDrive/Email/Teams as allowed by my company.

[SCOPE OF WHAT I NEED FROM YOU]

I want you to generate the following artifacts that I can use directly:

1) **Data Model & SharePoint List Definitions**
   - Design all the lists I need:
     - Employees
     - Attendance
     - Seats (with location/floor)
     - LeaveTypes
     - LeaveBalances
     - SeatBookings
   - For each list, provide:
     - Columns (InternalName, DisplayName, DataType, example values)
   - Provide the list definitions in:
     - A human-readable table
     - PLUS a set of CSV templates (one per list) that I could upload into SharePoint to pre-populate data (e.g., sample seats, sample leave types).

2) **Power Apps Canvas App Specification (Employee-Facing)**
   - App will be phone layout and will be later added to Teams.
   - Propose screens:
     - scr_Home
     - scr_MarkAttendance
     - scr_SeatBooking
     - scr_MyBookings
     - scr_MyLeaveBalance
   - For each screen, provide:
     - Controls with clear names (e.g. btn_SubmitAttendance, dd_Status, gal_AvailableSeats).
     - For each important control, list:
       - Property name (e.g. Items, OnSelect, Default, Visible)
       - Power Fx formulas, fully written out.
     - Explain each formula in plain language so I understand what it does.
   - Provide the build instructions in a strict **click-by-click format**, for example:
     - “Open make.powerapps.com, click Create → Canvas app → Phone layout…”
     - “On the left panel, rename App to App_Attendance by clicking …”
     - “Insert a Button control and name it btn_MarkTodayAttendance, set its Text property to …”
     - etc.

3) **Power Automate Flow Designs**
   - I will create these flows manually in the Power Automate UI.
   - I need you to design:
     a) “OnAttendanceSubmit_NotifyOrLog” (optional)
     b) “OnSeatBooking_NotifyUser” – sends Teams or email confirmation.
     c) “DailyReminder_MarkAttendance” – optional reminder to users who have not marked attendance.
   - For each flow:
     - Give me:
       - Flow name
       - Trigger type (e.g. When an item is created in SharePoint list X)
       - List name and site URL (placeholder is fine, I will adjust).
       - Each action with:
         - Action type (e.g. “Post adaptive card in a chat or channel”, “Send an email (V2)”)
         - Configuration fields (which dynamic content goes where)
         - Any expressions (e.g. formatDateTime, if, coalesce).
     - Provide the flow steps in a numbered, click-by-click format I can follow exactly.

4) **Admin View Specification**
   - Either:
     - Additional screens in same canvas app with admin-only visibility, or
     - A second admin-only canvas app (you recommend which is better under standard licensing).
   - For admin views, define:
     - Screens (e.g. scr_AdminDashboard, scr_AdminAttendance, scr_AdminSeatBookings, scr_AdminLeaveBalances).
     - Galleries/tables with filters for date, status, location.
     - Key Power Fx formulas for filtering and sorting.

5) **Implementation Guide Document**
   - At the end, produce a structured “Implementation Guide” in Markdown format with:
     - Phase 1: Create SharePoint lists (using your table + CSV).
     - Phase 2: Build Canvas App screens with step-by-step instructions.
     - Phase 3: Create flows in Power Automate.
     - Phase 4: Test and validate (with a checklist).
   - This document should be something I can bring into my office tenant and follow linearly.

[STYLE & LEVEL OF DETAIL]

- Assume I am doing this for the first time.
- Use clear headings, bullet points, and code blocks for formulas and CSV samples.
- Avoid saying “do the rest similarly”; be explicit for at least one full flow and one full screen.
- Use realistic example values where helpful.

Now, start by:
1. Designing the data model (lists and columns).
2. Then generating CSV templates for each list that I can import into SharePoint.
